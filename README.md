# AI Webpage

**The Process:**

Working with AI to create a webpage was both efficient and eye-opening. The process highlighted the strengths of generative tools, as well as the areas where human oversight is still essential.  

**What worked well:**  

AI was able to generate the initial **HTML structure** quickly. This gave me a strong starting point without having to build everything line by line. It also suggested design features and layouts that I might not have considered on my own. Having a full draft produced in seconds saved time and made it easier to experiment with different ideas.  

**What Surprised Me:**

I was surprised at how well the AI handled repetitive coding tasks and best practices, such as semantic HTML and responsive design hints. However, I also learned that the AI occasionally made assumptions that didnâ€™t fit my project. This made me more aware of the importance of writing **clear, specific prompts** when collaborating with AI.
